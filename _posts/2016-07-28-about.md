# About me

James Allen-Robertson is a Lecturer in Media and Communication in the Department of Sociology, University of Essex. In an earlier life he was the founding administrator of the Cambridge INET Institute, specialising in convoluted Excel lookup tables and the calculation of university overheads. Before he became an adult he toured Essex as a guitarist with the band Audrey II, and still nostalgically dreams of rock and roll excess whilst drinking peppermint tea.
